code name                       description

ode_model.py                Latest version of the ODE fitting routine, no M phase uses G2_plus_M as a composite phase (USE THIS)
run_fit.py                  Runs the fitting routine for all (or a subset of) cells for a given drug
run_fit_rep.py              Runs the fitting routine for each replicate separately 
submit_fit.py               Submits fitting jobs for the specified drugs (cell-cycle drugs)
wrangle_data.py             Wrangles data from        
                            /BrCaLines_profiling/ProfilingPaper/cell_cycle_data/merged/batches1to11_gating.results.csv',                                   converts fractions into cell counts, modifies namespaces of 'cell_line' and 'agent'
